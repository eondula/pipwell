# pipwell

pipwell is a platform designed to address the challenges of misdiagnoses in the healthcare industry. It aims to reduce diagnostic errors, assist overworked healthcare providers, minimize delayed diagnoses, and overcome communication barriers.

## Features
- **Conversational Symptom Analysis**: We use a language model, specifically chatGPT, to interpret patient input conversationally. This system processes the patient's descriptions of symptoms and translates them into a concise, structured summary, optimized to a maximum of 10 words, which is then relayed to healthcare professionals, ensuring efficient and standardized communication.
- **Blockchain**: Ensures the decentralization of medical records, enhancing security and trust.
- **IoT Heart Rate Monitor**: Offers real-time heart rate monitoring for patients.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes important health metrics and records.
